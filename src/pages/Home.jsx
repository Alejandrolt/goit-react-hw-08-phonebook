            Our dream of transforming the public services industry in Colombia
            and the world began in 2013. Juan Pablo Rojas, our CEO, discovered
            the power of load curves to measure energy consumption in real time
            and in this way create exponential strategies. that would change the
            behavior of people's consumption habits to be more efficient.
