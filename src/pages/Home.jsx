            The company itself is a very successful company. We can help him,
            because the pain of the mind's problems here prevents them from
            happening no matter what he seeks. At what moment did you choose
            this question of mind? The client himself, the client, may pursue
            the adipisation of the company. And the pain, and the flattery, that
            repel him when it comes to choosing. Are some people forced to
            suffer pain for what they don't, and the most deserving pains are
            the guilt and, above all, not the benefits?
